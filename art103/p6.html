     <h5>The Questions</h5> 
      
      <ul>
      <li>Q1. -- From the podcast, how has our understanding of what dinoasaurs really look like evolved? Describe the progression of how we portrayed them and how might this effect our understanding of what Archeology is saying about them.</li>
      <li>Q2. -- The artist/archcologist John Conway who is doing interpretaions of dinosaurs is obviously taking liberty with what could be the actual truth of how these creatures existed. What other fields of science, creative based disciplines and forms of studies use similer techniques that reminds you of this method or process. Please elaborate with your examples both written as well as images and links.</li>
      <li>Q3. -- First, summerize in your own words the defination of 'Material Speculation' as described in the second and fourth article. Then, given the examples in the second article as well as the other examples provided of possible future products, how can 'Material Speculation' also be used to create speculative objects that refer to the past? What might be an example of a fictional object form the past, that creates the same dynamic of speculation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>My Answers</h5> 

      <ul>

        <li>Q1. We portrayed dinosaurs as giant lizards, hairless, muscular and slow, but now they have change to describe dinosaurs as having bird feathers, athletic, different skins or possibly even chunky.</li>
        <li>Q2. . I would guess Nasa and the scientists who determine how other planets look like. We have information such as what chemicals make up a planet and images of earth mars and the moon so it helps us interpret what the surface of a planet might look like. Artists create possible renders of planets that we haven’t been on. Another example would be Crime, and finding a suspect. Details about their appearance or clothes will help an artist create a sketch of a possible suspect.</li>
          <li>Q3. . Material speculation to me right now means: When something is made to seem as if it is from a certain place, time, or world and subliminally implying as if it is, when it is not. </li>

        <p>The one that I want to further explore would be the world where dogs can talk. I think it would be cool to see a dog car and how the seats, controls, doors etc. would be customized for them to drive. I think it would be cool to see how we can work with them and help them develop a functional car for a dog. I imagine them with lowered cars and tall curved windows. I imagine the ones who like big cars would have walk ramps that come out for them to walk up. My last ideas is if the car was redesigned like the millenium falcon and had a walk ramp up the middle. That would be cool!</p>
