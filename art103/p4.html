         <h5> Questions</h5>
		<p>
      Q1. What are the differences between Site Specific art work and the idea of Art Interventions.
        <ul>
          <li>
            I think site specific art relies more on its placement and how the environment around it enhances the art. Art interventions are artworks that can be site specific but they are repurposing the area itself. 
          </li>
        </ul> 
        </p>
        <p>
        Q2. Choose 2 of the 4 artists shared and answer the following for each artist.
        <ul>
          <li>
            I think site specific art relies more on its placement and how the environment around it enhances the art. Art interventions are artworks that can be site specific but they are repurposing the area itself. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p> 
      <p>
        A. Take one or more of the art works from the listed artists and please describe how a piece(s) function as site specific work or an intervention. Please provide context and examples to explain your answer.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The lightning rods from Walter de Maria are site specific because the specific area they are placed is known for having a lot of lightning strikes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        B. For the same piece(s), explain your interpretation of the work. What does it mean to you?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          -I feel like the artwork is perfect for its location because it is too big to fit in a museum and it needs the lightning from the site. My first interpretation of the work is an energy generating field. It would be cool if they collected electricity from the lightning strikes to power a city grid.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Q3. What is the single most important that all signs must share to be relevant and effective? This means ALL signs, from art signs to traffic signs, to signs even in our home. This is NOT about aesthetics or construction, but just functionality of the idea.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The single most important thing that all signs must share is site specific. Where the sign is placed is specific to its function. If we take a bathroom sign and hang it up in our room then its purpose is no longer site specific.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Q4. What Kind of art, (not shown here), have you seen that was made in response to its location, its environment, a specific event or situation. Please elaborate on its description and provide 1 image for reference.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I have been to Rome, Italy and visited the Sistine Chapel. I believe the artwork painted by Michelangelo it is site specific because it is located in the Vatican church. If they were located in my house, it would lose its purpose because I don’t follow their beliefs. 
          </li>
      </ul>
