         <br>

         <p>
          As a fan of Star Wars and fan made animations, I decided to create my own fan made story by combining my favorite characters (Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Darth Maul) and putting them into one character. My character takes place during the 36,000 BBY (Before Battle of Yavin) years ago. I came up with a character from Maul's planet Dathomir, (which is known for the Nightsisters who have magical powers and cross breed with Zabrak (Nightbrothers) species who are known to be force sensitive to create Darth Maul) but was recruited by Mandolorians later to find out he has Jedi powers but chooses to fight for good like Luke Skywalker. His name is Radic.
         </p>

         <br>

      <em>Backstory:</em>
         </p> 

         <br>

         <p>
          The Mandalorians are a clan of warriors composed of members of multiple species all bound by a common creed, language, and code. Radic was the offspring of Zabrak species and Dathomirians. His skin was a dark golden-yellow but didn't have the traditional face tattoos because although he was strong, he chose not to be a warrior for he did not believe in killing. He lived a normal life until he was a teenager when his parents were killed by the Infinite Empire after they invaded Dathomir to learn more about the dark side of the force. He was taken in by Madalorians who were on a mission on planet Dathomir to stop the Infinite Empire, but were too late and found the boy holding his fathers lifeless body. His mother was taken by the empire so that they could force her to teach them the ways of the dark side and he wanted to save her but was too young.
         </p>
         <p>
          Radic left with the Mandalorians and started to learn their ways. As years passed, he began to get stronger and faster with the thought of saving his mother one day. On his final training, he was offered to join the creed and presented him with a helmet that barred the Zabrak horns of his father on the top. After joining the creed and accepting the mandalorian way, Radic goes on a mission to planet Atollon to find clues on his mothers location, they are overpowered by a giant Krykna which is a giant spider-like creature. Radic loses his weapon and just before the spider goes in to bite him, Radic raises his hands and forces the Krykna to fly back realizing that he has force abilities like his parents. The creed adds fang style horns to the front of his helmet to represent his defeat of the krykna. The Mandalorians find Radic’s mother’s location and set off on a mission to save her and stop the Infinite Empires quest to learn more about the dark side of the force.
         </p>
         <p>
          This artifact is a tiny replica helmet of the Dathomirian Mandalorian name Radic who had Jedi powers, but followed the Mandalorian ways. It was said that he led mandalore to fight against the corrupt council of the Infinite Empire during the Pre-Republic Era. His life came to an end during the battle against the Rakata where he sacrificed himself to destroy their advanced technology and diminish their long-time use of the dark side of the force and save the galaxy by ridding the Infinite Empire of their strongest weapon, advanced technology. His helmet survived the explosion after he took it off to see his mother one last time.

          <h5>My Custom Teapot</h5>
    
     <p>
       When customizing my own teapot, I had a few funny ideas but the one that stuck in my head was the "I'm a little teapot" song. Therefore, I customized it to look like it is making that gesture.
