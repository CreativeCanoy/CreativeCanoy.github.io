         <h5> Phase 2 3D Fastener BrainStorming Designs and Goldilocks Laser Tests</h5>
		<p>
      In phase 2 we tested different designs and materials, In my first attempt I used plike board and I tried to 'hand cut' throughole finger tenons. The design was really rough because I was not able to get little detailed cuts like a laser cutter, but the exercise helped me understand how it works. The second design was in adobe illustrator and I used the same method as the tessalation exercise to match the sizes and input the measurments to match the thickness of the board in order to give it a flush look.

        <h5> Phase 3 Goldilocks Fastener tests: Intitial Designs and Cuts</h5>
          
     <p>
      The first cut was with finger slots and locked in a little tight because I nudged the inside corners in farther than I needed to. The second goldilocks test was with throughole finger tenons of my own design and I tried to have a center lock with one support on each side. The locks fit but were also a little too tight due to over nudging.

          <h5>Final Project</h5>
     <p>
       For our final design, we created a 'build your own path' type of activity reguarding forest fires and called it <em> REDWOOD, FIREWOOD</em>. We came up with designs and shared them on discord. Zak and I worked on editing objects that were cutting off sections of the design because some of the lines were connected or too close to the edge that the objects would fall apart.

          I ran into another problem when I went to cut and the files sent to me were scaled down after we already added the fastner design. Scaling the designs down with the fasteners changed the dimention of the fastener so it was no longer wide enough to fit the board. On the right is the pile I had to discard.

          <h5>Artist Statement</h5>
     <p>
      For this project we had many ups and downs. Getting a chance to laser-cut became our biggest enemy. For example, we planned to laser cut on a Friday and after waiting for other groups to finish, it was finally our turn and just as we begin cutting, the wood-shop worker announced that they are closing in 10 minutes. So we didn’t	get to cut much and there was no other place open on the weekend. Monday came and oak did some test cuts but we needed more wood so I took the day off to get supplies and get our pieces cut. The only problem was that the pieces were scaled down after we already added the fastener; therefore, the fastener was too small to fit on the board. I began editing everyones files with new fasteners and allowed others to laser-cut while I worked. Everyone made their designs differently so some took more editing than others because corners weren’t connected or lines were too close to the edge. Zak came after his morning class and began editing with me. Thankfully he was able to scale up the images and fit the fasteners. It was a rush against time again waiting for groups to finish cutting, but we managed to cut our pieces before getting in trouble for taking too long. Everyone helped with post production, Jessica made the schema and Diana make the slideshow, while Zak took photos and sent them to Jessica for our Video Editing. Some things that work are people helping and stepping up when needed but the different styles and ideas are hard to work with. You never know how group projects will go, there can be a person making all of the decisions or you can let other ideas join and find ways to incorperate them. Luckily my team was very adaptable and everyone had their special contribution.
